Sum of Two Numbers
Write a program that takes two integers and outputs their sum. The program should correctly handle both positive and negative numbers. Ensure the output follows the format a + b = sum.
Maximum of Three
The program receives three integers as input and determines the largest one. If all numbers are equal, output any of them. The solution should be efficient and not use built-in max functions.
Even or Odd Check
Write code that checks if a user-input number is even. Print Even if true and Odd otherwise. Consider that the number could be zero.
Factorial of a Number
Create a program that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. Implement the solution using a loop. Remember that the factorial of 0 is 1.
Reverse a String
The program should take a string and print it in reverse order. The solution must not use built-in string reversal functions. Account for strings containing spaces.
Prime Number Check
Write code that checks if an input number is prime. A number is prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. Optimize the check to avoid testing all divisors up to N.
Sum of Array Elements
The program should calculate the sum of all elements in an integer array. The array can be hardcoded or user-input. Ensure the solution works with arrays of different lengths.
Substring Search
Write a program that searches for an input substring in a given string. Print the position of the first occurrence or a message if the substring is not found. The solution should be case-insensitive.
Simple Calculator
Create a basic calculator supporting +, -, *, / operations. The program should take two numbers and an operator, then output the result. Handle division by zero and invalid operators.
Fibonacci Sequence
Write a program that prints the first N Fibonacci numbers. The number N is user-input. Implement the solution using a loop, avoiding recursion for optimization.
